#  My Photon diary
Following [Chris Belcher's](https://gist.github.com/chris-belcher/ca5051285c6f8d38693fd127575be44d) approach of keeping a diary, I'll be using this repo as a place where I document what I've been working and what I plan to work on next for the duration of my SquareCrypto grant. 

It may also be interesting to my collaborators and donors, and anyone who wants to follow how my projects are going.

## June 2021
- Rewrote the unit tests making sure they are all asynchronus
- Released v0.2!
- Continued designing the photon demo app in Figma (I'm thinking of naming it Quantum)
- Watched Apple's WWDC21 event. I plan to strat using the new DocC features in Xcode13. I am now learning the new Swift features Apple is introduding
- Reached out to a number of developers for a code review and also to evangelise Photon library to developers who might want to incorporate it into their wallet

## July 2021
- I got a new computer and deployed a photon server locally to be used for testing but also to answer questions other developers had
- A user reported a configuration issue with the Xcode project. I spent some time researching and fixing the issue
- Finalised the design of the photon demo app in Figma
- Reached out to a few iOS app developers to see if theyâ€™re interested in using Photon in their applications
- Progress was slower than expected this month due to a number of personal issues
